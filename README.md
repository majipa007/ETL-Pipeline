# **ETL Pipeline for Hospital Data Analytics**

## **Overview**

This project is an **ETL pipeline** designed to process hospital data for analytical purposes. The pipeline extracts raw data, applies transformations to create meaningful data models, and loads it into a data warehouse optimized for analytics and reporting. 

### **Objective**
To provide actionable insights into hospital operations by organizing data into **fact and dimension tables** that support advanced queries and visualization.

### **1. Data Extraction**
- Extracts raw data from CSV files or other external sources.
- Data is loaded into **staging tables** in a PostgreSQL database.

### **2. Data Transformation**
- **Staging Data**: Prepares raw data for transformation by cleaning and validating it.
- **Dimension Tables**: Creates tables for entities like doctors, patients, hospital branches, and risk profiles.
- **Fact Tables**: Consolidates metrics (e.g., revenue, visits) tied to dimensions for advanced analytics.

### **3. Data Loading**
- Loads transformed data into **production tables** in the data warehouse.
- Data is structured to support BI tools like Tableau or Power BI for reporting.

## **Data Model**

### **Dimension Tables**
- **`dim_doctors`**: Information about doctors (e.g., name, department).
- **`dim_branches`**: Hospital branch details.
- **`dim_risk`**: Profiles based on patient risk levels.
- **`dim_patients`**: Patient-specific information.

### **Fact Table**
- **`fact_patient_visits`**: Contains metrics like revenue, number of visits, and time to service, linked to dimension tables via surrogate keys.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Incorporate real-time data streaming.
- Migrate the pipeline to cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
- Integrate machine learning models for predictive analytics.
